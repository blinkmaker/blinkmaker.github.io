This website is a glimpse of my learning, progress and ideas. 

### My inspiration
I have been very impressed by open source projects which contributed to my own learning. My goal with this website is to promote the same mindset of openly sharing knowledge through my work and ideas. I hope that these open source projects will be useful to other electronic hobbyists, enthusiasts and students.  
Feedback, suggestions and any improvements towards the projects are most welcome.

### Proudly part of the Maker Movement

I'm a big fan and supporter of the [Maker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture). I strongly believe that knowledge should be shared for the greater good and to inspire more people to create and make things even better. I have put a lot of work into the projects showcased on this website. The project code and designs can be freely used and tweaked. If you found my work helpful, it would be great if you could share a link to your project.

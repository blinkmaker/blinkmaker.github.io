This website is a glimpse of my progress, ideas and adventures in electronics.  

### Why BlinkMaker?
My username is based on two personally meaningful words:
* 'Blink': For beginners starting out in electronics or even seasoned veterans working with new microcontrollers and various programming languages, usually it all starts with blinking an LED. It is like the 'Hello, World!' of programming, but for electronics.  
* 'Maker': I am passionate about the Maker Movement and how people put some much effort to share what their knowledge and even help others, most of the time, for free. It brings together people who share the same interests and helps others discover something that they might want to get involved or explore on their own.

### My inspiration
I have been very impressed by open source projects which contributed to my own learning. My goal with this website is to promote the same mindset of openly sharing knowledge through my work and ideas. I hope that these open source projects will be useful to other electronic hobbyists, enthusiasts and students.  
Feedback, suggestions and any improvements towards the projects are most welcome.

### Proudly part of the Maker Movement
I'm a big fan and supporter of the [Maker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture). I strongly believe that knowledge should be shared for the greater good and to inspire more people to create and make things even better. I have put a lot of work into the projects showcased on this website. The project code and designs can be freely used and tweaked. If you found my work helpful, it would be great if you could share a link to your project.

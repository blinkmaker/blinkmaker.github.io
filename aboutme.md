subtitle: Hi. I'm Shakeel, an electronics enthusiast and student.

This website is a glimpse into my electronic learning, testing and projects at various levels. My username is based on a simple combination of two words; **blink**: Getting started with electronics usually involves blinking an LED - it is like the 'Hello, World!' of programming and **maker**: I feel very inspired with the growing [Maker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture) and the incredible talent of contributors sharing their ideas, knowledge and helping others for free.

### My inspiration
I've stumbled across many impressive projects which turned out to be fully open source. The hard work by the community of makers is very inspiring and greatly appreciated. It allows anyone free access to improve their knowledge and skills. This website aims to promote the same mindset of sharing knowledge. I hope that my posts will be useful to other electronic hobbyists, enthusiasts and students. Feedback, suggestions and improvements are most welcome.

### Proudly part of the Maker Movement
I'm a fan and supporter of the [Maker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture). Knowledge should be shared for the greater good and to inspire more people to create and make things even better. A lot of work has gone into the projects showcased on this website. The project code and designs can be freely used and tweaked. If you're using any part of my work, please include a reference/link. Also, it would be nice if you share a link to your project.

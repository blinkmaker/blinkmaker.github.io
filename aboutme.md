This website is a glimpse of my progress, ideas and adventures in electronics.  

### Why BlinkMaker?
It is based on two personally meaningful words:
* 'Blink': Getting started in electronics or working with new microcontrollers as well as learning various programming languages, usually it all starts with blinking an LED. It is like the 'Hello, World!' of programming, but for electronics.  
* 'Maker': I am passionate about the Maker Movement and all the people contributing at various levels to share their knowledge and helping others for free! It brings together people who have the same interests and helps others discover something that they might want to get involved or feel encouraged to explore on their own.

### My inspiration
I've come across lots of very impressive projects which turned out to be fully open source and  contributed considerably to my own learning. My goal with this website is to promote the same mindset of openly sharing knowledge through my work and ideas. I hope that these open source projects will be useful to other electronic hobbyists, enthusiasts and students.  
Feedback, suggestions and any improvements towards the projects are most welcome.

### Proudly part of the Maker Movement
I'm a big fan and supporter of the [Maker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture). I strongly believe that knowledge should be shared for the greater good and to inspire more people to create and make things even better. I have put a lot of work into the projects showcased on this website. The project code and designs can be freely used and tweaked. If you found my work helpful, it would be great if you could share a link to your project.

This website is a glimpse of my progress, ideas and adventures in electronics.  

### Why BlinkMaker?
My moniker is based on two personally meaningful words:
* **Blink**: In the beginning, it all starts with blinking an LED - it is the 'Hello, World!' of programming for electronics.  
* **Maker**: I am very passionate about the Maker Movement with the huge and growing number of contributors at various levels to share their knowledge and help others for free.

### My inspiration
I've come across many impressive projects which turned out to be fully open source. I appreciate all the hard work that has been made available by the community of makers as it allows anyone who is willing to spend some time and with enough motivation to continuously improve their knowledge and skills. My goal with this website is to promote the same mindset of openly sharing knowledge. I hope that my posts will be useful to other electronic hobbyists, enthusiasts and students.  
Feedback, suggestions and any improvements towards the projects are most welcome.

### Proudly part of the Maker Movement
I'm a big fan and supporter of the [Maker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture). I strongly believe that knowledge should be shared for the greater good and to inspire more people to create and make things even better. I have put a lot of work into the projects showcased on this website. The project code and designs can be freely used and tweaked. If you found my work helpful, it would be great if you could share a link to your project.

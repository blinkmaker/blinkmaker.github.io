### My inspiration
I have been very impressed by open source projects which contributed to my own learning. My goal with this website is to promote the same mindset of openly sharing knowledge through my work and ideas. I hope that these open source projects will be useful to other electronic hobbyists, enthusiasts and students.  
Feedback, suggestions and any improvements towards the projects are most welcome.

### Proudly part of the Maker Movement
